Congratulations to Stanislava and Ilya on defending their bachelor’s theses!

<!--more-->

Today our lab congratulates Ilya Gerasimov and Stanislava Vostrikova, who have both earned top marks for their bachelor’s theses. Ilya presented a model that blends large-eddy simulations with machine learning techniques to speed up predictions of pollutant dispersion in the atmospheric boundary layer, while Stanislava showed how ML algorithms—together with the extensive dataset she compiled—can more accurately reconstruct time-series of relative humidity over the ocean. We are proud of their achievements and look forward to their continued contributions to our research team.
