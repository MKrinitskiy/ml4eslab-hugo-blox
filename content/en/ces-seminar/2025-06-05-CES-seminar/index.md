summary: "In the context of global climate change and anthropogenic pressure, it is essential to identify and protect unique biological resources, such as invertebrate endemics of Lake Baikal, which serve as indicators of ecosystem health. Population studies are crucial for the effective management of natural resources and for planning environmental protection efforts. This work is devoted to the development of new methods for analyzing genetic polymorphism data from natural populations of Baikal's invertebrate endemics, aimed at providing a more detailed characterization of both ongoing and historical population processes. The primary goal is to develop and validate deep learning models that can uncover scenarios leading to observed patterns of genetic diversity. The study introduces the following models:
* a model for identifying population structures that change their reproductive strategies depending on environmental conditions;
* a model for detecting climate change based on polymorphism data;
* a model for clustering genetic sequences according to the organismsâ€™ habitat.
These models are expected to enhance the effectiveness of population genetic research in the future."

The talk focuses on the development and application of deep learning models to address problems in population genetics, using invertebrate endemics of Lake Baikal as a case study. The presented neural network approaches enable estimation of the ratio between sexual and asexual reproduction, detection of climate change signals in genetic data, and clustering of DNA sequences using autoencoders. These models demonstrate high accuracy compared to traditional methods and offer new prospects for analyzing the evolutionary history and structure of natural populations.
